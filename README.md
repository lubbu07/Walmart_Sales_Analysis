# 🛍 Walmart Sales Analysis | SQL + Python End-to-End Project

##  Overview

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/najirh/Walmart_SQL_Python/blob/main/walmart_project-piplelines.png)

This project is a hands-on implementation of a complete data analysis workflow on Walmart sales data. Using a combination of SQL and Python, I extracted, cleaned, analyzed, and loaded data to solve real-world business problems. The project emphasizes practical skills in data manipulation, querying relational databases, and delivering actionable insights for decision-making.

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, VS Code
- **Objective**: Establish an organized workspace and prepare the local environment for efficient data processing and development.

### 2. Kaggle API Configuration
- **Setup**: Generated and downloaded a Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Integration Steps**:
  - Stored the `kaggle.json` credentials file securely under `.kaggle/`.
  - Used `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>` to fetch the dataset programmatically.

### 3. Dataset Acquisition
- **Source**: Walmart sales data hosted on Kaggle.
- **Dataset URL**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
- **Storage Location**: Saved in the `data/` directory for streamlined access.

### 4. Library Installation & Data Loading
- **Required Libraries**:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
  ```
- **Data Import**: Loaded CSV files into Pandas DataFrames to perform initial inspection and preparation.

### 5. Initial Data Exploration
- **Purpose**: Understand column structure, detect anomalies, and identify transformations needed.
- **Methods Used**: `.info()`, `.head()`, `.describe()`, column type checking.

### 6. Data Cleaning Process
- Removed unnecessary duplicates to ensure accuracy.
- Treated missing or null entries through appropriate imputation or removal.
- Ensured consistent data types—converted strings to `datetime`, formatted currency fields, etc.
- Verified overall data integrity after transformations.

### 7. Feature Engineering
- Added a derived column `Total Amount` using:  
  `unit_price × quantity`
- These transformations improved downstream aggregation and analysis in SQL queries.

### 8. Database Integration
- **Connection Setup**: Used SQLAlchemy to connect Python to both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Table Creation & Insertion**: Defined schema and loaded processed data into database tables.
- **Validation**: Ran sample queries to confirm data insertion and structure accuracy.

##  Business Questions Solved

I designed and executed SQL queries to answer the following business-critical questions:

-  What are the revenue trends by store branch and product category?
-  Which categories and items are the best performers?
-  How does sales performance vary by city, weekday, and time?
-  What are the peak shopping periods during the week or day?
-  How do profit margins differ between locations and product types?
-  What are the most preferred payment methods among customers?

All queries were logged, and results interpreted to provide insights for operations and strategy.

-  Branch C generated the highest revenue, while Branch A had the best profit margins.
-  The Fashion category had the highest number of items sold across all cities.
-  E-wallet was the fastest-growing payment method, especially on weekends.
-  Evening hours and Fridays recorded peak sales.
-  Customer ratings were consistently higher in urban branches.
